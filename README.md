## Why sdag

Historically, managing interdependent jobs on Slurm clusters has been tough. While in the Cloud tools like [AirFlow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/) are available, their deployment in air-gapped HPC environments is usually very challenging as internet connection and tools like Docker or Kubernetes are not available. Therefore, teams often resort to relying on custom Bash scripts and makefiles, which quickly become large and hard to maintain as the project complexity grows.

sdag tries to fill this gap by providing a typed, code-first API. Its design loosely follows the one of Kubeflow, so it will feel natural if you already worked with it. However, it's way lighter! So it can easily run on HPC infra. Tasks are compiled down to a graph and executed by a Rust-based scheduler.

## Installation

sdag is not available on pypi yet (it's coming soon!). If you manage dependencies with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), you can directly install sdag from GitHub:

```sh
uv add "sdag @ git+https://github.com/igeniusai/sdag"
```

You can also install sdag as a tool to gain global access to it:

```sh
uv tool install "sdag @ git+https://github.com/igeniusai/sdag"
```

To install sdag with pip, first clone the GitHub repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/igeniusai/sdag.git
```

and then install sdag:

```sh
pip install path/to/sdag
```

If you face issues in the process, you likely have to install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) or update it to a more recent version via:

```sh
rustup update
```

## Getting started

After installing the library, copy the following snippet into a file named `hello.py`:

```py
from sdag import Script, pipeline


@pipeline
def hello_world() -> None:
    say_hello(name="sdag")


@hello_world.task(Script("sdag-execute"), cmd="bash")
def say_hello(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"hello from {name}")
```

To run the `hello` pipeline, execute:

```sh
sdag run hello:hello_world
```

Check out the [official documentation](https://github.com/igeniusai/sdag) for a detailed description of the features offered by sdag.

## Building from source and running tests

After cloning the repository, run:

```sh
uv sync --all-groups
```

to build the environment and:


```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

to activate it. Execute:

```sh
pytest
````

to run the Python tests and:

```sh
cargo test
```

to execute all Rust tests.

## Building the docs

Execute:

```sh
mkdocs serve
````

to build and serve the documentation. The server will be running at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
