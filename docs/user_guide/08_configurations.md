# Configurations

This section presents the configurations available in sdag.

## pyproject.toml

Configurations must be set under `[tool.sdag]`. Here are the available options:

| Option                       | Default value          | Description |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| dag-dir                      | "."          | Path where pipelines are searched. |
| compiled-dag-dir             | "./compiled-pipelines" | Compiled pipeline destination path. |
| cmd                          | null                   | If set, override the command of all tasks |
| prepend-compiled-dag-dir     | true                   | Prepend the `compiled-dag-dir` so you can write `sdag run dag.json` instead of `sdag run ./compiled-pipelines/dag.json` |
| log-level                    | "info"                 | Compiler, scheduler, and task log level |
| time_between_polls           | 5                      | Time between successive scheduler Slurm polls (seconds) |
| max-concurrency              | 0                     | Maximum number of tasks running at the same time. Set to zero to allow any number of tasks to run at the same time |
| slurm-grace-period           | 60                     | Maximum number of times a task can be missing from the Slurm output without considering it as failed. |
| max-concurrent-runs          | 20                     | Maximum number of runs of the same pipeline kept by sdag. Set to 0 to keep all runs. |
| fail-fast                    | false                  | If true, kill the scheduler and all running jobs if any task fails. |

In the `pyproject.toml` file you can also set a number of Sbatch options that will override those set in scripts or inside pipelines:

| Option           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| job-name         | Job name |
| nodes            | Number of nodes |
| account          | Account name |
| partition        | Partiton |
| qos              | Quality of Service |
| ntasks-per-node  | Number of tasks per node |
| cpus-per-task    | Number of CPUs per task |
| gpus-per-node    | Number of GPUs per node |
| time             | Wall time |
| mem              | Requested memory |
| output           | stdout file path |
| error            | stderr file path |

Check out the official [documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) for details. All these options are ignored if a task is marked as local. The `pyproject.toml` file also allows one to define tag configurations. Check out the [tag](../advanced/08_tags.md) section for details.

## .sdag.toml

If available, this file located in the main project directory. It has the exact same schema of `pyproject.toml`. However, configurations must not be placed under `[tool.sdag]`.

=== "`pyproject.toml`"

    ```toml
    [tool.sdag]
    dag-dir = "my_package/workflows"
    max-concurrency = 10
    ```

=== "`.sdag.toml`"

    ```toml
    dag-dir = "my_package/workflows"
    max-concurrency = 10
    ```

All configurations set in the `.sdag.toml` have higher priority with respect to those in `pyproject.toml` and they will override them when conflicting.
`.sdag.toml` is often ignored from git (although nothing prevents you from committing it if you find it useful) and treated somewhat like a `.env` to set things you might not want to push to a remote repo (like the Slurm `account` or `qos`). You can also use it to define machine-specific configurations that must override the default ones to transparently adapt the codebase to different clusters.

## Environment variables

Most environment variables are set by the scheduler, so users don't really have to think about them. However, a few environment variables can be set to modify the default behavior:

| Environment variable   | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `SDAG_HOME`            | Path of the sdag working directory. It's `~` by default. Inside it, a `.sdag` directory will be created |
| `SDAG_BASE_PATH`       | Base path of all artifacts. If set, it's automatically prepended to all artifact relative paths.        |
