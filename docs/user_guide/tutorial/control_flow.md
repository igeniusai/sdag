# Control Flow

## Branches

The pipeline structure can be dynamically altered based on the output of other tasks. Create the following two files in the main project directory:

=== "`control_flow.py`"

    ```py
    from sdag import Elif, Else, If, pipeline


    @pipeline
    def control_flow():
        with If(condition1()):
            option1()
        with Elif(condition2()):
            option2()
        with Else():
            option3()


    @control_flow.task("script.sh")
    def condition1() -> bool:
        return False


    @control_flow.task("script.sh")
    def condition2() -> bool:
        return True


    @control_flow.task("script.sh")
    def option1():
        print("Option 1 selected")


    @control_flow.task("script.sh")
    def option2():
        print("Option 2 selected")


    @control_flow.task("script.sh")
    def option3():
        print("Option 3 selected")
    ```

=== "`script.sh`"

    ```sh
    sdag-execute
    ```

`condition1` and `condition2` are tasks that **must** return a Boolean value. Run:

```sh
sdag run control_flow --local
```

to execute the example. The expected flow is:

1. `condition1` is executed and returns `False`.
2. Because the output is `False`, `option1` is skipped and `condition2` is evaluated.
3. The output of `condition2` is `True`, so `option2` is executed while `option3` is skipped.


## OneOf

One might expect the following snippet to work as expected:

```py
@pipeline
def dag():
    with If(condition1()):
        t = option1()
    with Else():
        t = option2()
    final_task(t)
```

Unfortunately, it's not! `t` in the example will always refer to `option2`. The `oneof` node is inspired by Kubeflow and it can be used to reference tasks running on separate branches. Add the following snippet to the same `control_flow.py` module:

```py
from sdag import oneof


@pipeline
def oneof_example():
    with If(condition()):
        t1 = first_alternative()
    with Else():
        t2 = second_alternative()
    t = oneof(t1, t2)
    final_task(t)


@oneof_example.task("script.sh")
def condition() -> bool:
    return False


@oneof_example.task("script.sh")
def first_alternative():
    print("alternative 1 selected")


@oneof_example.task("script.sh")
def second_alternative():
    print("alternative 2 selected")


@oneof_example.task("script.sh")
def final_task():
    print("final task")
```

Here, `final_task` will only run if at least one between `first_alternative` and `second_alternative` executes successfully. You can run the example through:

```sh
sdag run oneof_example --local
```

You can also use `oneof` when multiple concurrent tasks executed. It will become the first task of the pool that completes the execution without errors.

```py
@pipeline
def dag():
    t_fail = will_fail()
    t_slow = slow_task()
    t_fast = fast_task()

    # Likely equal to t_fast
    first_to_complete = oneof(t_fail, t_slow, t_fast)
```

!!! info
    To run these examples with Slurm, turn `script.sh` into a [sbatch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) script as explained in the [Hello World](hello_world.md) section and execute pipelines without the `--local` option.
